                I recently discovered the
                <a href="https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark" target="_blank">
                    Shadowdark
                </a>
                tabletop roleplaying game
                and was so impressed that I sat down and started coding
                tools to aid Shadowdark players.

        </div>
